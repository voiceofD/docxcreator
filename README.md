# docxcreator

This is a small program that builds some docx files!

Using this GUI Application, you can build MS Word (.docx) files pretty easily. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the proof of concept as to how documents can be created on the fly to meet various requirements. 


**The unique features of this program are:

1) This program allows you to easily perform the operations that most people do on MS Word: Create coverpages, define margins (in Cm/Inches), upload images to your document, define tables, write paragraphs, headings, and add page breaks with various formatting options (Bold, Italic, Underline, Alignment).
2) This application also has a record feature which starts recording the instructions that you give, once you toggle the record button. It then repeats the recorded instructions a specified number of times, allowing you to 
    --> Seamlessly create multiple copies of a page without any hassles
    --> Simplify the process of creating templates
    --> Create templates for invoices and so on...
